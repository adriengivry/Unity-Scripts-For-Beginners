 * This script aims to provide you a very simple implementation of a day and night cycle for your unity projects

 * A directional light is a type of light that emits light strait forward. The sun can be
 * represented in Unity by a directional light, the moon too.
 * In order to get a day and night cycle, we need to make the directional light rotating.
